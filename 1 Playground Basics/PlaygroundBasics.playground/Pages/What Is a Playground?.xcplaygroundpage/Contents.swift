That area is called the _results sidebar_. As you add or change code, the playground runs your code again and updates the results in the sidebar.
 
- experiment:
    - Click a line of code to move the cursor there.
    - Type to start editing code.
    - Change the numbers a few times.
    - Add a few new numbers, each on a separate line.\
Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.

Next, find out how to put the results sidebar to better use.
