 ## Exercise: Counting Votes

 In the Arrays and Loops playground, you had a chance to create a function that would tally votes from classmates. At the time, you could only ask yes-no questions that could be held in Boolean results.
 
 You were worried that using strings would result in voting mistakes from typos. But now that youâ€™ve studied enums, you can safely make your voting system a bit more sophisticated:
