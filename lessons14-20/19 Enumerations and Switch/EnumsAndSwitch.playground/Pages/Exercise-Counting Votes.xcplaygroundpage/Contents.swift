 ## Exercise: Counting Votes

 In the Arrays and Loops playground, you had a chance to create a function that would tally votes from classmates. At the time, you could only ask yes-no questions that could be held in Boolean results.
 
 You were worried that using strings would result in voting mistakes from typos. But now that you’ve studied enums, you can safely make your voting system a bit more sophisticated:

    case beach, chocolateFactory
